Web3-
Web3 is a generic term that describes the vision for a better internet. Web3 is a platform that uses blockchains, cryptocurrency, and NFTs to return power to users in the form of ownership. Web3 is not concerned with creating a similar web of hyperlinked resources but rather solving issues around asset ownership, both digital and physical. The client/server model of the Web has been used over “http/https,” whereas “Web3”, as it is being proposed, uses a decentralized model using blockchain-based protocols.
Web3 is not an evolution of the internet but rather a proposal for an alternative.

Web3 was created by Gavin Wood, co-founder of Ethereum, in 2014. Its core purpose is to combat the centralized power of some Web2 giants such as Amazon and Google.

What is Web3’s importance?

-It grants you ownership
Web3 allows you to take control of your digital assets in a unique way. 
Web3 allows direct ownership via non-fungible tokens, and your ownership is not transferable by anyone, even the game creators. You can also sell or trade in-game items on the open market to recoup their value if you quit playing.

-Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)
Web3 allows you to own your data and can also be a part of a collective that owns the platform using tokens. These tokens act as shares in a company, and DAOs allow you to coordinate the decentralized ownership and make decisions about the future of a platform.

DAOs can be described as smart contracts that are agreed upon and automate decision-making in a decentralized manner over a pool (tokens) of resources. The code performs the voting results by allowing users to vote on how resources are spent.

Many Web3 communities are referred to as DAOs by users. Each community has a different level of automation by code and decentralization.

-Identity
You would normally create an account on every platform that you use. You might have Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit accounts. You can change your profile picture or display name, which must be done across all accounts. Although social sign-ins can be used in certain cases, censorship poses a problem. These platforms can quickly lock you out from your entire online existence. You will need to give them your personal information to create an account.

Web3 addresses these issues by allowing you to control your digital identity via an Ethereum address or ENS profile. Using an Ethereum address provides a single login across secure, censorship-resistant, and anonymous platforms.

-Native payments
Web 2.0’s payment infrastructure depends on banks and payment processing companies, excluding people who don’t have bank accounts or live in the wrong country. Web3 uses tokens such as ETH for money transfers directly from the browser, and it does not require any trusted third parties.

Web3 and Web 3.0 differ, but there are similarities
Web3, decentralized Web, and Web 3.0, the semantic Web, want to offer an alternative web to the current one, which they see as broken.

They have a different focus. The semantic Web, or Web 3.0, focuses on efficiency and intelligence by reusing data and linking it across websites. Web3, or the decentralized Web, focuses on security and empowerment by giving people control over identity and data.

It is also important to note that they use different technology to reach their goals. Web3 is built upon the blockchain, and web 3.0 uses data interchange technology like RDF and SPARQL. OWL and SKOS. This difference has the important consequence that Web3 (blockchain) data is hard to modify (distributed over many places), while Web3.0 data is easy to modify.

Despite their differences in focus, their methods are similar. Both want user data to remain under the control and ownership of the user. This data is stored in a Solid pod for the semantic Web and in a crypto wallet for Web3. The difference is that data is centrally stored in a solid pod. On the contrary, a crypto wallet holds keys to assets that reside decentralized on the blockchain, while a traditional wallet does not.

The core difference between the two is that Web3 has a decentralized structure, and Web3.0 has a semantic or linked structure.
